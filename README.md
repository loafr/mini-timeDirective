mini-timeDirective 
==================

##Objectives
The purpose of this Mini Project is to get you used to creating custom Directives. Custom directives are one of the most powerful aspects of Angular because they allow you to create re-usable components.

###Step 1: Angular Skeleton 
* Fork this repo, then clone your fork.
* Create the basics of your Angular application. Your file structure should look like this
```
  mini-routing
    index.html
    js
      app.js
      mainCtrl.js
      timeDirective.js
```
Remember to include ng-app in your html and call your module 'timeApp'. Also, remember to include the Angular CDN as a script in your HTML along with app.js, mainCtrl.js, and timeDirective.js. Go ahead and create your 'timeApp' module in your app.js file.
